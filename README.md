## How to Turn in Assignments

First, create a folder in your PythonAnywhere account called "homework". Put all of your future homework in this file.

Second, create a python file named after the problem set, such as "problem-set-1.py" and so forth, every time you're working on an assignment.

Third, at the top of your code, in a comment, write down the name of the problem set and your name like so. Make sure to include the top line (```#!/usr/bin/env python2.7```) I've pasted here as well:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python2.7
# Problem Set 0
# Name: Sisi Wei

def example(x):
  print x
```

Fourth, complete and run your code to make sure it works! That's it.

A few things to note:
- I'll able to view all of your homework sites from inside PythonAnywhere, so there's no need to send it to me! If your "problem-set-1.py" is in the homework folder on your account, it will count as being digitally accessible to me by the deadline.
- <b>Do not edit/open/save/do anything with your homework assignments past the deadline.</b> The timestamps on the files are what I'll be using to determine whether you've turned in your homework on time. If you are done before the deadline, but then decide to edit the file again after the deadline, it will appear to me as if you've turned it in late.


## Late Policy Reminder

Since I’ll be going over the answers the day after assignments are due, late assignments will automatically receive zero points. Turn in assignments by the deadline, even if you’re unsure of some of your answers.
